## Exciting News!

ACTS is proud to announce it has received an Arts Project Support Grant once again from the Indiana Arts Commission! We are eternally grateful for the IAC's continued support, and for the support of our donors and audience members, without whom we could not provide the Seymour area with our artistic presentations. THANK YOU ALL!
