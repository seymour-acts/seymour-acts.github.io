## Audition Notice

Auditions for our next play are coming up! Join us on January 8-9, 2017, at 7:00pm at Suite 208 in the Shoppes at Seymour for auditions for "I Bet Your Life" by Fred Carmichael. This raucous comedy follows Matt, Greg, and Stacy: a soap opera writer, his agent, and their shared secretary. Matt has written a movie script that Greg claims is impossible. Matt therefore wagers Greg that the script IS plausible by setting up the plot to happen in real life - Matt hires an unknown hitman to kill Greg if Greg cannot guess who the hitman is in time! Is it real? Is it a con? Is the conman getting conned himself? Join us for auditions for 4 male roles (ages 30+) and 5 female roles (ages 20+) for this crazy comedy! Performances will be March 31, April 1 & 7-8, 2017. Directed by Betty Baute.
