## Next Production: "I Bet Your Life" by Fred Carmichael

ACTS is proud to present our next production, "I Bet Your Life" by Fred Carmichael. Performances will be March 31, April 1, 7, & 8, 2017, located at our suite 208 in the Shoppes at Seymour outlet mall (357 Tanger Blvd). Doors will open at 7:00pm, and the show will begin at 7:30pm. Concessions will be available before the show and during the 15-minute intermission.

Hilarious situations, clever dialogue, intriguing romance and surprise twists make this breezy comedy a delight. Soap opera author Matthew Stoddard has written a screenplay about a terminally ill man who hires a hitman to kill him and then finds out he was misdiagnosed. Matt's agent and best friend, Gregory Larson, thinks the plot is not feasible, so Matt contacts a gangster and arranges for an incognito hitman to join them at a dinner party in the country to prove his point. Circumstances place a real hitman among the guests and the action accelerates as they try to find out who it is before the deadline. Stacy, secretary and love interest to both men, does her best to help them solve the identity question as surprise after surprise thwarts them. Is the whole scheme really a con game? And who cons the con man? And who is conning them all? Join us for an evening of mystery and laughs as the dinner party unfolds!

Directed by Betty Baute. Rated T for Teen+ audiences due to some adult themes.
