## Audition Notice

Auditions for our next play, "Mama Won't Fly" by Jones/Hope/Wooten, are Sunday, April 9, at 4pm and Monday, April 10, at 7pm in our suite 208 at the Shoppes at Seymour mall. The lead roles are three strong females ranging from 30s-70s, and there are smaller roles for a wide variety of actors ranging from 4 lines to 30 lines. These smaller roles may be doubled if necessary, but if you've been wanting to break into the acting scene, this is your chance to star without having to worry about a lot of memorization! Stop by and see us!

Show dates will be June 16-17 & 23-24, 2017. Directed by Betty Baute.
