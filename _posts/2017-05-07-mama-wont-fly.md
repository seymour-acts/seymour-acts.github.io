## Upcoming Production: "Mama Won't Fly" by Jones/Hope/Wooten

Laugh your way across the USA! ACTS presents its next production, the raucous Southern comedy "Mama Won't Fly" by Jones/Hope/Wooten.

Frustrated Savannah must drive her Mama (who refuses to fly in an airplane) cross-country to reach the wedding of the year, only to have Hayley, the bride-to-be, show up unexpectedly on the doorstep right before they hit the road. Will the three women bond together during their wild ride across the South, or will they drive each other batty before they even get halfway there? Will Hayley get cold feet? Will Savannah find her long-lost love? And will Mama ever STOP meddling in everyone's lives? Join Savannah, Hayley, and Mama for their hilarious journey as they meet kooky characters from all over the South!

Performances will be Friday & Saturday, June 16-17 & 23-24, with the doors opening at 7:00pmET and the show starting at 7:30pmET. This production will be held at our suite #208 in the Shoppes at Seymour outlet mall (357 Tanger Blvd, Seymour IN 47274). There will be one 15-minute intermission.
