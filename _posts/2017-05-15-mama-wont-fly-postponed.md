## ANNOUNCEMENT: Production Postponed & Replaced

Due to a cast emergency, "Mama Won't Fly" by Jones/Hope/Wooten has been postponed. The new dates will be September 8-9 & 15-16, 2017.

ACTS is proud to announce that AR Gurney's "Love Letters" will take over the performance dates previously set for "Mama Won't Fly".

"Love Letters" is a reader's theatre classic that follows a stiff-necked young man (portrayed by Jeremy Kinnett) and a free-spirited young woman (played by Kat Baute) as they explore their friendship and ultimately their deep and enduring love for each other. What begins as a simple invitation to a child's birthday party and its subsequent thank-you note evolves into a lifelong correspondence between Andrew and Melissa. Follow their epistolary journey in this powerfully emotional tale.

**Note:** This is a reader's theatre piece. This means the actors will have their scripts with them during the play. "Love Letters" was written to be very simply produced without a complex set or physical action, in order to enhance the emotion in the actors' words and tone - focusing on what the actors are *saying* rather than *doing*.

Performances will be June 16-17 & 23-24 at Suite 208 in the Shoppes at Seymour (357 Tanger Blvd, Seymour IN 47274). Doors will open at 7:00pmET, and the show will begin at 7:30pmET. Tickets are $10/person and will be available at the door and online [here](https://seymouracts.ticketleap.com/ll/). For more information, please call or text 812-498-2127 or [email us](mailto:katbaute.acts@gmail.com).
