## Audition Notice

Auditions for the next ACTS play, "Kosher Lutherans" by William Missouri Downs, will take place on Sunday, September 24, at 6:00pm and Monday, September 25, at 7:00pm at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shoppes at Seymour outlet mall.

Hanna and Franklyn are the perfect couple - or so it seems! They desperately want to have a child of their own, but are unable to do so, casting a shadow over their marriage. As the couple begins to wonder if they'll ever become parents, they have a chance encounter with a God-fearing, pregnant girl from Iowa, who offers to let the couple adopt her out-of-wedlock baby. Just before the adoption papers are signed, though, Hanna and Franklyn discover the girl is unaware they are Jewish. Knowing the revelation could throw a ratchet into the whole works, the couple poses as Lutherans to appeal to the girl's apparent Midwestern sensibilities. But how far are they willing to go to have a family?

There are parts for both men (ages 20-50) and women (late teens to early 50's). Show dates will be December 8-9 & 15-16, 2017. Directed by Elyse McGill. Produced with special permission by Samuel French, Inc.
