ACTS is proud to present their holiday play, "Kosher Lutherans" by William Missouri Downs, sponsored by Aaron's of Seymour. Performances will be Friday & Saturday, December 8-9 & 15-16, 2017. Doors open at 7:00pmET, and the show begins at 7:30pmET, at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shops at Seymour outlet mall.

Hanna and Franklyn are the perfect couple - or so it seems! They desperately want to have a child of their own, but are unable to do so, casting a shadow over their marriage. As the couple begins to wonder if they'll ever become parents, they have a chance encounter with a God-fearing, pregnant girl from Iowa, who offers to let the couple adopt her out-of-wedlock baby. Just before the adoption papers are signed, though, Hanna and Franklyn discover the girl is unaware they are Jewish. Knowing the revelation could throw a ratchet into the whole works, the couple poses as Lutherans to appeal to the girl's apparent Midwestern sensibilities. But how far are they willing to go to have a family?

Directed by Elyse McGill. Starring Amanda Bott, Cory Watson, Tim Gordon, Ashley Browning, Hannah McGill. Produced with special permission by Samuel French, Inc. Sponsored by Aaron's of Seymour, the National Endowment for the Arts, Indiana Arts Commission, and Columbus Area Arts Council.
