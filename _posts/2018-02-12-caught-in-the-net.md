## Upcoming Production

ACTS is proud to present their next comedy, "Caught in the Net" by Ray Cooney, sponsored by Aaron's of Seymour. Performances will be Friday & Saturday, April 6-7 & 13-14, 2018. Doors open at 7:00pmET, and the show begins at 7:30pmET, at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shops at Seymour outlet mall.

The sequel to Run for Your Wife, which ACTS performed in 2016, finds the bigamist taxi driver John Smith still keeping his two families in different parts of London, both happy and blissfully unaware of each other. However, his teenage children, a girl from one family and a boy from the other, have met on the Internet and are eager to meet in person since they have so much in commonâ€” name, surname and taxi driving dad! Keeping them apart plunges John into a hell hole of his own making, and the situation spirals out of control as John together with his neighbor, Stanley, juggles outrageously with the truth. Join us for a night of hilarity as we see if John and Stanley can keep it together, or if the whole story will unravel!
