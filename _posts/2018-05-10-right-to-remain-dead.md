## Upcoming Production

ACTS is proud to present their next comedy, "You Have the Right to Remain Dead" by Pat Cook. Performances will be Friday & Saturday, June 8-9 & 15-16, 2018. Doors open at 7:00pmET, and the show begins at 7:30pmET, at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shops at Seymour outlet mall.

You've just settled down in a theatre to solve a murder mystery. The narrator introduces you to the play, and you meet Fat Daddy, a rich but vindictive southern gentleman with an equally conniving and scheming family. So you know who's going to die, right? But who will the murderer be?

Will it be Sweet Mama, Daddy's pandering wife; Hyacinth, the daughter who's always cleaning the family firearms; Earl the worm, or his overly amorous wife, Savannah; or Clete, the sullen handyman who, for some reason, is in the will? Then Fat Daddy is discovered, dead as a hammer.

Except the corpse isn't Daddy'sâ€”it's the narrator's! The director comes on stage and the police arrive. Now you have to figure out which of the actors murdered the narrator. And not only are you questioning the cast, but they are questioning you! Yes, you are a suspect as well! This frantic comedy will have audiences guessing until the last clue is dropped and the last joke dies!

Tickets are $12/person and may be purchased at the door or [online](https://seymouracts.ticketleap.com/rtrd/). For more information, please call or text 812-498-2127 or email [katbaute.acts@gmail.com](mailto:katbaute.acts@gmail.com).

Directed by Kat Baute. Produced with special permission by Dramatic Publishing. Sponsored by the Indiana Arts Commission, Art Works, National Endowment for the Arts, Columbus Area Arts Council, Aaron's of Seymour, and Rose Acre Farms.
