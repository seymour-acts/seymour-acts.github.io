## Audition Notice

Auditions for the next ACTS play, "My First Time" by Ken Davenport, will take place on Monday and Tuesday, June 18-19, at 6:00pm-8:00pm at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shoppes at Seymour outlet mall.

"My First Time" features four actors in hysterical and heartbreaking stories about first sexual experiences written by real people. In 1998, a decade before blogging began, a website was created that allowed people to anonymously share their own true stories about their First Times. The website became an instant phenomenon as over 40,000 stories poured in from around the globe that were silly, sweet, absurd, funny, heterosexual, homosexual, shy, sexy and everything in between. And now, these true stories and all of the unique characters in them are brought to life by four actors in this acclaimed 90-minute play from Ken Davenport, producer of Altar Boyz and creator of The Awesome 80s Prom.

Four acting roles are available (2 men, 2 women), and we will also need two technical assistants; age/experience are not an issue. Show dates will be August 17-18 & 24-25, 2018. Directed by Kat Baute. For more information, or to arrange a private audition, please call/text 812-498-2127 or email [katbaute.acts@gmail.com](mailto:katbaute.acts@gmail.com). Produced with special permission by Samuel French, Inc.
