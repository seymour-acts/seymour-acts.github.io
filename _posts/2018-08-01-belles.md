## Upcoming Production

ACTS is proud to present their next production, "Belles" by Mark Dunn, a heartwarming drama/comedy about family struggles. Performances will be Friday & Saturday, August 17-18 & 24-25, 2018. Doors open at 7:00pmET, and the show begins at 7:30pmET, at the ACTS Suite 208 in the Shops at Seymour outlet mall.

Six sisters. Six homes. Six phones. Each sister has her own life, her own hopes, her own struggles. But when their mother has a medical issue, it's up to the eldest, Peggy, to try to pull the six together and reforge old ties. Join the sisters as they play phone-tag across the country in this heartwarming, charming, and witty family drama/comedy. Rated T for Teen+ audiences due to some strong language and innuendo.

Tickets are $12/person and may be purchased at the door or [online](https://seymouracts.ticketleap.com/belles/). For more information, please call or text 812-498-2127 or email [katbaute.acts@gmail.com](mailto:katbaute.acts@gmail.com).

Directed by Elyse McGill & Kat Baute. Produced with special permission by Samuel French, Inc. Sponsored by the Indiana Arts Commission, Art Works, National Endowment for the Arts, and Columbus Area Arts Council.
